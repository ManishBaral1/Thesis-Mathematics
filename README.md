# Thesis: On the Volume of the Intersection of Balls (Discrete Geometry)

## Abstract
Our project title is ”On the Volume of the intersection of balls ” and our aim
is to give Csikos formula for the intersection of balls. We mostly follow paper
Csi98[7] by Csikos and BCO2[3] by Bezdek and Connelly. The motivation of our
problem is ”Kneser and Poulsen Conjecture” which states that, in n-dimensional
Euclidean space E n , if we rearrange the balls in such a way that distance between
each pair of centers doesnot decrease, then volume of union of balls cannot decrease
and volume of intersection of balls cannot increase. It was first proposed by Martin
Kneser in 1955 and later in 1968 by Arne Poulsen. It has been proved for n=2
completely by Bezdek and Connelly in [3] but remains open for n ≥ 3. It been
proven under additional condition on the number of points N and the map p i → q i
for arbitrary E n .In the paper by Bezdek and Connelly the main idea used is the
Csikos formula which allows to calculate the derivative of volume of (union) of balls
as linear combination of derivatives of the distances between their centers with (non-
negative) coefficients. The expression (formula) for the union of balls was already
proved by Csikos in 1998[7]. The formula for intersection of balls can be obtained
in similiar way as union with slight(sign) change. This proving Csikos formula for
intersection case is the main problem we will be proving in this project.
